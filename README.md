# Simple API Request Project
This project is a simple implementation of an API request using JavaScript. The main objective was to fetch and process information from an external API as a foundation for future, more complex projects.

# Highlights
### Basic API Request: Uses JavaScript's fetch() method to retrieve data.
### Learning Milestone: A stepping stone to understanding how to work with APIs, making it easier to build more advanced projects later.
### Future-Focused: The knowledge gained here will be applied in subsequent projects.

# Purpose
This project serves as a hands-on introduction to API integration, helping me build confidence in handling data from external sources while planning for more ambitious applications in the future.
